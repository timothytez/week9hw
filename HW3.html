<!-- Overall, I have a much better understanding of how containers and children work in this concept.
Components are the building blocks of my application.it encapsulate a piece of the user interface
or functionality. Thos components recieve data through props, and render content to the DOM using JSX.
The containers are used to manage the state of hte application and can wrap multiple components.
Containers manage data, fetch data from APIs, and pass that data down to their child components as props.
Nesting components and containers allows me to create a structured, modular, and maintainable codebase.
Containers manage state and logic, while components handle rendering and presentation. This concept 
breaks down the information that wil be uploaded on my application.

I find myself getting mixed up and confused about the imports and exports of things. Another one of 
the concepts that I need to quickly understand is the installing. at times im not sure if I have installed
things correctly. The concept of elephant SQL is also somethinng I need to work on as well as firebase.-->
